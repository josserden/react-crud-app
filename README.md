# React CRUD Application

A simple React application that allows users to view and manage a list of users.

## Description

This application has three main pages:

1. A welcome page with a description of the application and a link to the users
   page.
2. A users page that displays a list of users in a table with the following
   fields: id, name, username. Users can be searched by name or username.
   Clicking on a user will take the user to the user details page.
3. A user details page that displays all of the data for the selected user.
   Users can navigate to the next or previous user.

The user data is retrieved from
[https://6251bfb67f7fa1b1ddde85d8.mockapi.io/api/users](https://mockapi.io/)and
stored in a Redux store using Redux Toolkit. Users can be added, edited, and
deleted using a modal form with validation for empty fields. The form for adding
a new user starts with a default structure. Edited records are displayed in a
different font. The application uses routing and can be hosted on GitHub.
